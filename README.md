This repo contains a TypeScript bug and its solution. The bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function expects a string but receives a string or null value.  The solution demonstrates how to handle the null value gracefully to resolve the type error.  This is a great example for understanding how to handle potential null values when dealing with strings in TypeScript.
